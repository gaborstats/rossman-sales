# rossman-sales
The task was to predict Rossman sales with a statistical model that is not too complicated but still performs well. Linear regression could not be used.  

I used decision tree with 5 fold cross-validation that could achieve R2 = 0.93 on the validation set.

The required data set, broken down to three parts (train, test, store) is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data
